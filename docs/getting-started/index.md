# Getting started

The goal of Dockerized Drupal initiative is to make Drupal development experience simpler, faster and more efficient than the conventional way of using the standard LAMP solution in a solo and a team environment.

To achieve that, we have built various tools and developed custom workflows around Docker ecosystem, so no matter what is your skill level and how complex your Drupal project is, you can focus on solving your particular problem at hand.

The initiative was started by two Drupal developers - [JÃ¼rgen VIljaste](https://www.drupal.org/u/viljaste) and [Mait Roosvalt](https://www.drupal.org/u/maitzzz) with the help of [Fenomen Agency](http://fenomen.ee/en).

If you are interested about the story why and how this project was born, please read or watch this DrupalCamp Baltics 2015 presentation: [Using Docker to boost your development experience with Drupal](https://github.com/dockerizedrupal/drupalcamp-baltics-2015).
